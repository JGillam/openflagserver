<h1>Instructions</h1>
<div>Search the target(s) specified by your instructor for flags and submit them to this scoring server.  Flags
    generally look like hexadecimal hashes unless otherwise specified (e.g. "327a6c4304ad5938eaf0efb6cc3e53dc").
    They are not case sensitive.</div>
<div>This server is considered out-of-scope for the CTF
    exercise.  Messing with it will earn disqualification.</div>
